Her last wish was to be presented as a different celebrity on each night of her wake, but her conservative father wants to bury her as a man. Trisha's friends are left with no choice but to steal her body and hold the wake in a secret location. And as Trisha is transformed to look like different celebrities, they also look back at the colorful and extraordinary life that she has led - being a son, a sister, a mother, a friend, a lover, a wife, and ultimately, a queen.</p><p>Genre: Comedy, Drama</p><p>Director: Jun Lana</p><p>Actors: Paolo Ballesteros, Joel Torre, Gladys Reyes, Luis Alandy</p><p>Writer: Jun Lana (story), Rody Vera (screenplay)</p><p>Rating: N/A</p><p>Runtime: 120 min</p></div>
