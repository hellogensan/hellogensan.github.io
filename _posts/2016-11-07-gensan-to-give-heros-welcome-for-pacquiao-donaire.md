GENERAL SANTOS CITY -- Boxers Manny Pacquiao and Nonito Donaire will be given a hero's welcome when they return to General Santos City, the city mayor said on Sunday.

General Santos City Mayor Ronnel Rivera said they are now coordinating with the teams of both Donaire and Pacquiao to prepare for the welcome.

Pacquiao on Sunday made history anew as he became the first active senator to win a world boxing championship.

The 37-year-old Pacquiao, who was elected a member of the Senate last May, overpowered the younger Jessie Vargas in 12 rounds, showed off his still remarkable speed and accuracy and flashed his punching power in front of a sellout crowd at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.

Donaire, on the other hand, lost his WBO super bantamweight title to Jessie Magdaleno.

In an interview with ABS-CBN News, Donaire's grandfather, Epiphanio Donaire, said he was disappointed with the outcome of his grandson's fight.

He added that he lost interest in watching the fight after he saw Donaire struggle to give Magdaleno a good fight.

"Wala na akong gana manood. 'Yun nga eh, parang wala siya sa mood maglaro. Parang matamlay siya," the older Donaire said.
(I lost interest in the match. It seemed like he was not in the mood to fight. He looked as if he was not in a good condition.)

Epiphanio, however, is hoping that Nonito will ask for a rematch against Magdaleno, who maintained his undefeated record following Sunday's match.

"Sa palagay ko makakabangon pa 'yan kasi hindi naman siya gaanong nahirapan," he added.
(I believe he can stand up to the challenge because he did not suffer that much during the fight.)

Meanwhile, boxing fans in General Santos City also expressed their disappointment over Sunday's match results as they were expecting a double celebration had Donaire also won.

At least 2,000 fans flocked the General Santos Gym to witness the fight of the Filipino boxers.
