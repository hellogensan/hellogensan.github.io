GENERAL SANTOS CITY — Thousands of boxing fans here will have the chance to witness for free the historic bid on Sunday of the city’s favorite son, Senator Emmanuel Pacquiao, to become the first-ever active senator to win a world boxing championship.

This, as the city government will open anew the 5,000-capacity city gymnasium in Barangay Lagao here for Pacquiao’s World Boxing Organization (WBO) welterweight title fight against current champion Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas.

Lady Manalo, City Sports and Development Office head, said Saturday they have finalized the necessary arrangements for the live cable streaming via pay-per-view of the highly anticipated Pacquiao-Vargas bout.

She said the local government has purchased a pay-per-view subscription with a cable television provider to allow the live streaming of the fight.

The official said they have distributed tickets to the city’s 26 barangay councils for reserved seats at the gymnasium.

“We have allotted free tickets for every barangay and they may avail (of these) on a first-come, first-served basis,” she said.

City Mayor Ronnel Rivera earlier endorsed the free live viewing of the Pacquiao-Vargas at the city gymnasium that has become a tradition for the area.

Pacquiao, who was elected to the Senate in the May 9 elections, grew up in Barangay Labangal here.

The eight-division world boxing champion, who is considered a local hero, declared his retirement from boxing after dominating then WBO welterweight champion Timothy Bradley in a non-title bout last April but later decided to make a comeback.

Manalo said the released tickets guarantee seats at the court area and lower box of the city gymnasium.

The upper box or the general admission section of the gymnasium will be open to the public on a first-come first-served basis, she said.

She said residents who do not get the free tickets and fail to come early for the general admission seats could still view the fight for free through television sets that will be set up outside the gymnasium.

The gymnasium will open at 8 a.m. on Sunday for the live telecast — starting from the undercards to the main event.

The local government will strictly implement the city gymnasium’s standing policy against the bringing of food and any beverage inside the facility.

The bringing of flammable materials like lighters, bladed weapons and related items are also prohibited.

“We will strictly implement the city’s anti-smoking policy. Smoking will only be allowed in designated areas,” Manalo said.

For the venue’s security, she said they have tapped the city police, civil security unit and the Army-led Joint Task Force GenSan to handle the arrangements.

Sr. Supt. Maximo Layugan, city police director, said they have prepared a security plan for the entire city during Sunday’s Pacquiao-Vargas fight.

“But we’re expecting another zero crime rate day based on previous experience,” he told reporters.

Aside from the city government, some barangay councils here will also be offering free live telecasts of the fight.

In Sarangani, Gov. Steve Chiongbian Solon said free live streaming of the fight will also be offered at the provincial gymnasium in Alabel town.
